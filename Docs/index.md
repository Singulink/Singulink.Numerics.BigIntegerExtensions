# Singulink.Numerics.BigIntegerExtensions

**BigIntegerExtensions** provides some helper `BigInteger` extension methods and a super fast power cache that serves as a replacement for `BigInteger.Pow()` for bases between 3 and 10 (inclusive) to quickly get cached values instead of calculating them each time they are needed. This library is used by [Singulink.Numerics.BigDecimal](https://www.singulink.com/Docs/Singulink.Numerics.BigDecimal/) to improve performance and support its operations.

**Singulink.Numerics.BigIntegerExtensions** is part of the **Singulink Libraries** collection. Visit https://github.com/Singulink/ to see the full list of libraries available.
